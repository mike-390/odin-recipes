    <h1>Butterhorn Dinner Rolls</h1>
    <p>TButterhorn dinner rolls date all the way back to colonial times, but I've streamlined the process to make this <br> recipe easier for new and inexperienced bakers. These classic dinner rolls are light but rich, and slightly sweet. <br> They're perfect for special occasions or holiday dinners, alongside any main course.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <Ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> <br> <p>Sprinkle yeast onto warm water. Stir gently and let sit until foamy <br> and frothy, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> <br> <p>While the yeast is proofing, place butter in a saucepan with milk <br> and white sugar. Turn heat to medium and cook, stirring <br> occasionally, until butter melts and sugar dissolves, 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> <br> <p>Remove from the heat and pour into a large mixing bowl; let cool until just very warm to the touch and about 120 degrees F (49 <br> degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes.</p></li>  
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> <br> <p>Add 3 cups flour, kosher salt, yeast mixture, and egg; mix gently <br> with a spatula until it all comes together and forms a very thick <br> and wet batter. Add remaining 3/4 cup flour and mix with your <br> fingers, incorporating just the amount of flour you need, until <br> dough comes together into a soft, sticky ball.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> <br> <p>Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.</p></li> 
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> <br> <p>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth and <br> elastic, about 5 minutes.</p></li> 
        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> <br> <p>Grease the bowl with butter. Place the dough back into the bowl, cover, and let rise for 30 minutes.</p></li> 
        <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> <br> <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking <br> sheet with a silicone liner (such as Silpat®).</p></li> 
        <li><strong>Step 9:</strong> <br> <p>Transfer dough back to a work surface and press it into a 1-inch <br> thick circle. Flip over and continue pressing until circle is 1/2-inch <br> thick; use a rolling pin if needed to achieve correct thickness. Use a <br> pizza tool to cut dough into 12 equal wedges.</p></li> 
        <li><strong>Step 10:</strong> <br> <p>Starting at the larger end of one wedge, roll toward the point, <br> stretching the ends of the dough out for the first few inches. Pinch <br> and press the point into the dough to seal and place, seam-side <br> down, on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining <br> dough.</p></li> 
        <li><strong>Step 11:</strong> <br> <p>Let rolls sit until they puff up a little, 15 to 20 minutes.</p></li> 
        <li><strong>Step 12:</strong> <br> <p>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until cooked through and <br> just starting to turn a light golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</p></li> 
        <li><strong>Step 12:</strong> <br> <p>Remove from the oven and immediately brush hot rolls with <br> melted butter. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, 15 to 20 <br> minutes.</p></li>
