    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent dough sheets</li>
        <li>1 quart oil, or as needed, for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>chocolate sauce or chocolate hazelnut spread for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <Ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> <br> <p>Remove dough from each can and unroll to a rectangular shape.<br> Fold the shorter end of 1 sheet up 1/3 of the way. Fold the opposite <br> edge 1/3 of the way to fold over (and cover) the first fold. The <br> dough should have 3 layers. Use a 3-inch cutter to cut 3 circles <br> from the dough. Form the scraps into another layered piece and <br> cut out one more circle. Repeat with the remaining dough sheet. <br> Use a smaller cutter to cut the center out of each circle to form a <br> donut shape and reserve for donut holes.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> <br> <p>Fill a large saucepan halfway with oil and place over medium-high <br> heat to reach a temperature of 350 to 365 degrees F (175 to 183 <br> degrees C). Line a tray with paper towels.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> <br> <p>Combine sugar and cinnamon in a shallow dish; set aside.</p></li>  
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> <br> <p>Working with 2 to 3 cronuts at a time, carefully lower each cronut <br> into the hot oil. Fry about 1 minute, rotating occasionally, until <br> browned evenly. Drain briefly on the prepared tray. While donuts <br> are still hot, coat evenly in cinnamon sugar. Repeat with remaining <br> cronuts and doughnut holes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> <br> <p>Serve with chocolate sauce or hazelnut spread for dipping.</p></li>
