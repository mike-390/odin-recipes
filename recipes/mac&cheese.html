    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Macaroni and cheese:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bread Crump Topping:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Step 1:</strong> <br> <p> Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 <br> degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</p></li>
        <li> <strong>Step 2:</strong> <br> <p> To make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly <br> salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring <br> occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it <br> will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared <br> baking dish.</p></li>
        <li> <strong>Step 3:</strong> <br> <p> While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium <br> skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture <br> becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li> <strong>Step 4:</strong> <br> <p> Gradually whisk 2 ½ cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a <br> simmer.</p></li>
        <li> <strong>Step 5:</strong> <br> <p> Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; <br> season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until <br> cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding <br> up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed.</p></li>
        <li> <strong>Step 6:</strong> <br> <p> Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</p></li>
        <li> <strong>Step 7:</strong> <br> <p> Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a <br> skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until <br> well coated and browned.</p></li>
        <li> <strong>Step 8:</strong> <br> <p> Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle <br> with paprika.</p></li>
        <li> <strong>Step 9:</strong> <br> <p> Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and <br> macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</p></li>
    </ul>
